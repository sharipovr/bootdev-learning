# bootdev-learning
I manually created this initial repository for Boot.dev exercises and tutorials.

2025-10-14  I chose as a tutorial path the option "Back-end Developer Path in Python & Go". Its url is 
https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-code-python

2025-11-10  Continue doing exercises / challenges appearing in the learning path, but future projects will be created in separate repositories.
